### My story

As certified nutrition consultant and a Ph.D. in Microbiology, my holistic health practice takes a comprehensive approach to microbiome health for disease prevention and treatment. By merging the knowledge of nutrition and microbiology, I emphasize the vital role of the microbiome in maintaining overall health. Through personalized consultations and evidence-based interventions, I strive to optimize the microbial balance within the human body, harnessing its potential to support immunity, digestion, and overall well-being. Together, these credentials enable me to offer a unique perspective on promoting health through the understanding and cultivation of a balanced microbiome.
